# oppenheimer_website
This project is an interactive, scroll-based website about J. Robert Oppenheimer, combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js for 3D visuals. As users scroll, scenes change dynamically, telling Oppenheimer's story with smooth transitions and responsive design. The dark-themed aesthetic and 3D elements create an engaging, educational experience.
